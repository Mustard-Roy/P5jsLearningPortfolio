        Proposal
      </h1>

      <p>
        The technological developments have led to the generation of negative
        effects. According to Fuzzy Logic Modelling Of The Impact of Using
        Technology On Anxiety And Aggression Levels Of Students, extended and
        uncontrolled use of technology inevitably cause psychological, physical
        and behavioral disorders. <br /><br />
        In order to help more people realize how they rely on the technology at
        hand in their daily life that may bring out increasing tech anxiety, I
        develop this game to simulate a particular day’s life as a college
        student. <br /><br />
        The player firstly gets up at home in the morning and buys breakfast.
        Then, he drives to school along the road. Next, he takes a class at
        school and has meal from the food stalls near the school. Finally, he
        goes back home, has some entertainment and goes to sleep. In such 4
        scenes including home in the morning, road, school and home at night,
        player collects coins and answers the questions about whether they tend
        to use the technology or not in a certain circumstance. At the end of
        the day, a score from previous answers is shown and the game tells you
        how you depend on the technology and how you are likely to be tech
        anxious.<br />

      <h1>
        Reflection
      </h1>
      <p>
        It’s a lot of work!<br /><br />
        Unlike other game engine, p5.js doesn’t have the specific functions for
        the game elements like operate animations, collision detection, build-in
        interface, game nodes, etc. So, I have to figure them out all by myself.
        <br /><br />
        Specially, I want to introduce my ways of collecting coins (showing
        questions) and detecting collision.<br /><br />
        For collecting coins, each coin is built as an object with parameters
        including showing status, coordinates, questions, question types,
        special operations for different answers and new coins to add. Then,
        when the player ‘intersects’ with the coin, questions, interfaces and
        following operations are shown based on those parameters.<br /><br />
        For detecting collision, I manually define the rectangles as obstacles
        with diagonal coordinates. So, when the player is moving, the game will
        calculate whether players rectangle is about to intersect with the
        obstacle rectangles according to the moving direction. As an example,
        the obstacle rectangles in the first scene, home, is shown as red
        rectangles below.<br /><br />
